# WordPress Core Installer
This is a [custom Composer installer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/custom-installers.md) for WordPress core. It is a proof of concept, but feel free to use it. The package is on [packagist](http://packagist.org) and the package name is `psycle-wordpress/wordpress-core-installer`.

### Usage
To set up a custom WordPress build package to use this as a custom installer, add the following to your package's composer file:

```
"type": "wordpress-core",
"require": {
	"psycle-wordpress/wordpress-core-installer": "~0.1"
}
```

By default, this package will install a WordPress Core type package in the `wordpress` directory. To change this you can add the following to either your custom WordPress core type package or the root composer package:

```
"extra": {
	"wordpress-install-dir": "custom/path"
}
```

The root composer package can also declare custom paths as an object keyed by package name:

```
"extra": {
	"wordpress-install-dir": {
		"wordpress/wordpress": "wordpress",
		"psycle-wordpress/wordpress": "psy-wordpress"
	}
}
```
